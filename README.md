# Accounting-System

This project aims to develop a simple accounting system where users can create, manage, and issue accounting vouchers using two main entities: *Detail (DL)* and *Summary (SL)*. The system supports full CRUD operations for these entities, with various validation rules in place to ensure data integrity. Accounting vouchers can be generated based on these entities, with rules ensuring balanced transactions.
